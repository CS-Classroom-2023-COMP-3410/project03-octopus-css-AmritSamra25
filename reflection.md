For this project, I started by comparing my unstyled HTML to the screenshot and breaking the page into clear sections like the header, main content, quiz area, table, and footer. I used the existing IDs in the HTML so I could style each part without changing the overall structure of the page.
The main challenge was matching the layout of the quiz section. In the screenshot, the quiz content is on the left while the octopus image appears on the right with a purple border. To recreate this, I made the quiz section position relative and positioned the image absolutely in the top right corner. I also adjusted the label widths so the input fields line up properly and don’t overlap the image. Another small challenge was making the word “mantle” appear red without affecting the rest of the sentence, which I solved by styling it using a class.
Another challenge was getting the text hierarchy to match the screenshot. The “INTRODUCTION” and “AMAZING FACTS” headings are bold and uppercase, so I used text transform and font weight to make those sections stand out more clearly.
Overall, the process involved a lot of trial and error, making small changes, refreshing the page, and comparing it to the screenshot until the spacing, colors, and alignment looked right. Using padding, margins, and font styling helped achieve a close match without changing the original HTML structure.
